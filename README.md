 i-Wish Project Description

i-Wish is a desktop application that allows users to create a wish list, add friends, view friends' wish lists, and contribute to the purchase of items from their friends' lists. The application provides a fun and interactive way for users to make their friends happy by gifting them items from their wish lists.

The client-side of the application provides several features including user registration and sign-in, adding or removing friends, accepting or declining friend requests, creating, updating, and deleting wish lists, viewing friends' lists, and contributing to the purchase of items from friends' lists. The application also notifies users when an item has been purchased or received as a gift.

The application's user interface is designed to be user-friendly, providing an enjoyable experience for users. The use of JavaFX ensures that the GUI is easy to navigate and visually appealing.

The server-side of the application is responsible for handling client connections, requests, and the completion of shared gift items. The server is also responsible for manipulating the database, including connecting to it, executing queries, and adding items to the database, which users can then use to build their wish lists. The server is designed to handle a large number of users, ensuring that the application remains stable and responsive.
